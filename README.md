** Project - Your Custom C Library

Welcome to the project, a comprehensive C library designed to be a foundational toolkit for your programming needs. This project focuses on implementing essential functions, offering a versatile set of tools to streamline your C programming tasks.

** Project Overview **

What does the project offer? The project is a collection of essential C functions covering a range of tasks, including string manipulation, memory allocation, linked list operations, and more. It provides a versatile toolbox to help you write efficient and clean code without the need to reinvent the wheel for common tasks.

The library includes functions such as ft_strlen, ft_strcpy, ft_memset, and ft_lstnew, among others. Each function is crafted with attention to performance, clarity, and adherence to standard C library conventions.

** How to Compile the Project **

To compile the project library, follow these simple steps:

- Clone the Repository:
    - git clone git@github.com:Bgarnn/C-customLib.git
    - cd C-customLib
- Compile the Library:
    - make:  This will generate the libft.a static library.
- Clean the Build:
    - make clean: This removes the object files, keeping only the compiled library.
    
** Now you're ready to integrate the project into your programs! Simply link your programs with libft.a during compilation.
